# Drone Fee Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Smart Contract Update**
   - Modified `DeliveryEscrow.sol` to return the 10% drone fee to the sender (job poster) if no drone is assigned, instead of sending it to the fee wallet
   - Recompiled the contract

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Added UI components to display the drone fee calculation (10% of base amount)
   - Updated the UI to show both the base amount and total amount (base + drone fee)
   - Added detailed explanation of how the fee structure works
   - Modified the form to display a breakdown of the fees

3. **Deployment**
   - Created a deployment script (`scripts/deploy-contract.js`) that can be used to deploy the updated contract if desired
   - Created a compile script (`compile.js`) for compiling the Solidity contract

## Fee Structure
- 80% of the base amount goes to the recipient
- 10% of the base amount goes to the platform fee wallet
- 10% drone fee:
  - Goes to the drone operator if a drone is assigned
  - Returns to the sender if no drone is assigned

## Example
If a user enters 0.2 SEI as the base amount:
- Total charged: 0.22 SEI (including 0.02 SEI drone fee)
- 0.16 SEI (80%) to recipient
- 0.02 SEI (10%) to platform fee wallet
- 0.02 SEI (10%) to drone operator or returned to sender

## Next Steps
To fully implement this change on-chain, the contract needs to be deployed and the address updated in both the backend and frontend. For now, we've updated the frontend to correctly inform users about the fee structure.

The drone fee is transparent and users are informed that:
- The fee is returned if no drone is assigned
- The fee is paid to the drone operator if one is assigned
